788. Rotated Digits
X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we
get a valid number that is different from X. Each digit must be rotated - we
cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8
rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other; 6 and 9 rotate to each
other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other number and become
invalid.

Now given a positive number N, how many numbers X from 1 to N are good?

Example:
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation:
There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after
rotating. Note:

N  will be in range [1, 10000].
